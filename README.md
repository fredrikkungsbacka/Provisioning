This is a script to provision, make standard changes and reporting to Cisco devices.
It provides integration with Vandyke SecureCRT, Cisco Identity Service Engine, Cisco DNA-Center, Microsoft Active Directory and Solarwinds.

The script is written in Python and uses a collection of JSON-files to collect settings and information.

This version is specific for public release and will not work without adding the users specific settings and configurations.
